This Reddit Audio Recap project is a FastAPI-based asynchronous backend that scrapes recent Reddit posts and news articles filtered to the last two weeks using custom scrapers with aiolimiter for rate limiting and tenacity for retry logic. It employs LangChain agents integrated with Anthropic Claude-3.5-sonnet and Ollama LLMs to analyze and summarize top Reddit posts per topic, extracting discussion points, sentiment, and notable quotes. Summaries are converted to high-fidelity MP3 audio using the ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API, specifically leveraging the eleven_multilingual_v2 voice model with voice ID JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb, producing nuanced, expressive speech. The Streamlit frontend manages topic input and selection, sends JSON requests to the backend, and streams or offers downloads of the generated audio. The system uses async concurrency for scraping and processing, MCP tools for Reddit interaction, and environment variables for secure API key management, delivering a scalable, low-latency pipeline for context-rich, community-driven audio news recaps.
